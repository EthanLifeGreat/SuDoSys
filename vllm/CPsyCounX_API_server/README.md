# Folder for starting API server of CPsyCounX

Before run CPSyCounX.sh in the parent folder, DO THIS:

1. Copy all files in [CPsyCounX](https://huggingface.co/CAS-SIAT-XinHai/CPsyCounX) to the folder "CPsyCounX". (Model files are too large to upload.)
2. Run model_class.py to check if the fine-tuned model is capable of running.
3. Run CPSyCounX.sh to start the API server.
